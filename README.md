# Taskify

A minimalistic Todo List application that allows users to manage their tasks efficiently with a simple and clean user interface.

## Thought Process

The goal of Taskyfy was to create a straightforward and user-friendly todo application that allows users to add, manage, and organize their tasks with minimal effort. The application supports a drag-and-drop feature for task management, enabling users to easily move tasks between different states (In Progress, Completed) without any complex interactions.
